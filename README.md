# Park N' Go

This is our BostonHackathon project that we demoed. It give you the best places to park,
using data from Liberty Mutuals shine API. Also it overlays a heat map of the so called 
'dangerous' places that have been classified as dangerous by a classifier we built using the
Crimes in Boston data we found on Kaggle. 

Using the ease of the web and the power of Data Mining we combined the two in this project
to allow people live safer.
